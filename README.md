README - Code Refactor Challenge.

Project Description:

The purpose of this project was to alter an existing website so that it would meet accessibility and search engine optimization standards.\
While the website in the starter code mostly worked (aside from a broken link), a number of improvements were needed in order for the code to be more accessible/readable.

List of notable edits made:\
    -Fixed broken SEO link.\
    -Consolidated colors used in the CSS stylesheet into a single root element.\
    -Added descriptive site title.\
    -Added semantic HTML elements.\
    -Consolidated several duplicate CSS style elements.\
    -Fixed the "Horiseon" h1 element to make it more readable in the index.html file.\
    -Added alt text to image hrefs.\
    -Moved index.html to root directory.\
    -Added a descriptive README file.\
    -Added comments to CSS style elements to explain their purpose.\
    -Within the style.css file: Improved readability by aligning CSS style elements with their corresponding HTML elements (as best as possible).
